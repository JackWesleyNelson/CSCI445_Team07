					<li>Uncover a mine, and the game ends.</li>
					<li>Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.</li>
					<li>Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.</li>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Mark the mines. </b>If you suspect a square conceals a mine, right-click it. This puts a flag on the square. (If you're not sure, right-click again to make it a question mark.)</li>
					<li><b>Study the patterns. </b>If three squares in a row display 2-3-2, then you know three mines are probably lined up beside that row. If a square says 8, every surrounding square is mined.</li>
					<li><b>Explore the unexplored. </b>Not sure where to click next? Try clearing some unexplored territory. You're better off clicking in the middle of unmarked squares than in an area you suspect is mined.</li>
